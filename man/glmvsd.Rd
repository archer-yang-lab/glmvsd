\title{Variable Selection Deviation (VSD)}
\description{
The package calculate the variable selection deviation (VSD) to measure the uncertainty of the selection in terms of inclusion of predictors in the model.
}
\usage{
glmvsd(x, y, n_train = ceiling(n/2), 
n_rep = 100, model_check, 
psi = 1, method = c("union", "customize"), 
candidate_models, 
weight_function = c("ARM", "ARM.Prior", "BIC", "BIC.Prior"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{Matrix of predictors.}

  \item{y}{Response variable.}

  \item{n_train}{Size of training set when the weight function is ARM or ARM with prior. The default value is \code{n_train}=ceiling(n/2).}

  \item{n_rep}{Number of replications when the weight function is ARM and ARM with prior. The default value is \code{n_rep=100}.}

  \item{model_check}{The index of base model for calculating the VSD measure.}

  \item{psi}{The size of un-normalized prior weight. The default value is 1.}

  \item{method}{Users choose one of the \code{union} and \code{customize}. If \code{method=="union"}, then the program automatically provide the candidate models as a union of solution path of Lasso, SCAD, and MCP; If \code{method="customize"}, users must provide their own set of candidate models in the input argument \code{candidate_models} as a matrix, each row of which is a 0/1 index vector representing whether each variable included/excluded in the model.}

  \item{candidate_models}{Only available when \code{method="customize"}. It is a matrix of candidate models. each row of which is a 0/1 index vector representing whether each variable included/excluded in the model.}

  \item{weight_function}{Options for computing weights for VSD measure. Users choose one of the \code{ARM},  \code{ARM.Prior},  \code{BIC} and \code{BIC.Prior}. The default is \code{ARM}.}

\value{
A "glmvsd" object is retured. The components are:
 \item{VSD}{Variable selection deviation (VSD) value.}
 \item{VSD_minus}{The lower VSD value of \code{model_check}, representing a degree of false negative of  \code{model_check}.}
 \item{VSD_plus}{The upper VSD value of \code{model_check} model, representing a degree of false positive of  \code{model_check}.}
 \item{weight}{The weight for each candidate model.}
 \item{DIFF}{Counting the variable differences between candidate models and \code{model_check}.}
\item{candidate_models_cleaned}{Cleaned candidate models: the duplicated candidate models are cleaned; When computing VSD weights using BIC, the models with more than n-2 variables are removed (n is the number of observaitons); When computing VSD weights using ARM, the models with more than n_train-2 variables  are removed (n_train is the number of training observations).}
